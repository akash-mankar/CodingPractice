Data mining
Data given - interpret 
Buyer Sales Product Details.
MAchine learning algorithms. Supervised. UNsupervised.
Next days cost. predictive model. 
electricity usage, Cant produce more, produce exact.
Prediction Algorithms:
specific value- electricity or specific class-or-type 
Training set and validation set.
Trained on some specific input data. will have noise.
in validation, you ll check hows the performance. 

Supervised Algorithms:
parameters governments.  Electricity  proportional to Temprerature.
Linear regression. Determine the constant values.
IF the values don't match there is an error.
That coyold be because of inputs.
Somethings are undefined. some parameters are unknowns.
Try to minimize the error on training set.

Example:
Salary / Age - Predict the performance.
Normalize the input data.
Sclaing centering operations.
So that you predict correctly.
Lambda: Error + lambda = 0  
Vary lambda.
Accuracy is not great. so some parameter is missing.

Square Error: 
Gradient Dissent. curve points. mminimize error. 
Within Threshold ignore. only outliers  will affect the data. support vector machine.  SVM

Data processing
Analyze the data
Define co variances
Make scatter plots.
Finding parameters
	e.g. alcohol. we dont put accurate data age = 100/  Data is not corerect.
	So we need find otu what kind of data can be used.
	Centered features are more important. 
	Model should be able to see that.
PRinciple component analysis: figureing out centered parameter. Variance.
==============================
Still could be missing values.
In Medical field.
	some value missing. That measn something. Age, Blood PResssure.

	replace missing values instead of getting rid of entire row.
	replace with mean,. but dont do that. that would create a bias in the model.
	Pressure Temperature.
	relatuions ship. Replace using the relationship.

60 90 =============> data. So dont take 75.
Also ***feature selection****. Merge or split features.

	y = f(x)
		linear, X^2, X^3

classification of  data:
========================
tshirts large small medium -> Discrete Variable
nominal -> colros. no relationships.
ordinal variable.  no quiatifiable relationship between them

Use of this.
how to quaitify error?
cost small wrong medium ======= cost red wrong green high cost. Thats why classify the data.

Decision Tree: -> to classify data. 
regression Tree: -> try to different coefficients . Make regression tree.
SVM: Support vector machine. MAximiing the boundary . Threshold is margin. for dinstinct classes.
	for overlapping classes. 










Unsupervised :  No constant values are there. some output values are there.
Some inputs known. Give random values in case of unknowns. Calculated Error.
