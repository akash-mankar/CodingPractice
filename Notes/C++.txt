Virtual function
Inheritance
	
public private protected 

By default

Difference between a class and struct.
class has private by default. Struct has public by default.

public inheritance,
private inheritance,

multiple inheritance.

Types of constructor:
default: copy: move: parameterized: initializer list:
r value reference. in move : temporary object.
x = y + z; if x is already created it will call assignment operator. 
Otherwise, move constructor:

Virtual destructor: jiska destructor hain wohi call hoga.

Template: its a class/struct or a function.
Generic. can be instantiated differently for different types. Similar concept in java is generics.
Template specialization : write a specialized version for a specified type.

Interface and abstract 
Abstract: only one needs to be pure virtual. Can't be instantiated.
Interface: all are pure virtual so that all of them can be implemented.

Iterator: its a design pattern. Its an object that can be used to traverse a container.
Forward, random access, backword, input iterator, output iterator.

Composition c++. 
Abstract class:  even if one function is 
pure virtual function.
vritual function  = 0. implementation. that class cannot be instantiated.
Nor can a funtion take a type A. it can take a reference.

A base B derived
a = b. type b. function is still virtual.

Singleton in c++
class. private constructor:
Static poitner of class type. private.
Getinstance method. Static and public . Static method can access only static.
className::getInstance.

inherantce heirarchy hain toh destructor should be virtual.
 If you call a destructor of derived. it will always call destructor of base too.
 in vice versa case both destructors would be called only if A's destructor was virtual.

Virtual Function Table:
=======================
Vptr in each class and each class has a VTable.
http://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/125-the-virtual-table/


NameMangling: after compilation: namespace+class+function Name + HEx.
Same function Names: within same class. function overloading.
C -> cannot resolve.

Meta Programming:
=================
temprary objects: expression templates. Meta pogramming.

valgrind: memory profiling tool. memory leak it tells.
memory allocation calls. how many allocation. keep leaking memory.

New:
Types of new:  
Operator syntax:  allocate + construct
function syntax:  allocate
placement new: :  construct

Malloc:  makes a tree: based on the size of the memory block. jaisa size request hota hain waisa tree traverse karke nikalta hain
Free blocks: heap has free blocks: is not a system call.
Handles at user level.
